# Hello! Welcome to Hilary's Movie Manager app!

 ## What is it?

 This back-end API is the back-end database that works with my client front-end app for Movie Manager, located [here](https://hilarybrown.github.io/full-stack-client-front-end/). This back-end API holds the tables for my database and stores the data that the user inputs from the front-end client.

 ## Where Can I access it?

 Movie Manager back-end API is hosted on heroku,  [here](https://stormy-sea-27251.herokuapp.com/), and is also accessible via the website section at the top of this repository page.

## Technologies Used

 Some of the technologues used in my back-end API creation were:
 - Ruby for the database and all routes and actions associated
 - sh curl scripts tp run my testing for each action in my database

 ## My Development Process and Problem-Solving Strategy

 I walked through each CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) action piece-by-iece, testing along the way to make sure that each part was working correctly. I used curl scripts for testing my actions to make sure each action was able to interact with my database correctly. Luckily, I didn't run into too many issues when setting up my API and was able to get through each one step-by-step (with a little bit of rubber-ducking to our issues log).

 ## Unsolved Problems

 - None! Can you believe it?!

 ## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

 I created an ERD to show the relationships between my two tables, below
